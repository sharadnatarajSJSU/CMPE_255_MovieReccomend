CMPE 255 Group Project - Movie recommendation system


Problem Statement

With OTT platforms being the new way of watching content, a lot of content is hosted on a single streaming service. The user would have to search for specific content among a large collection of movies. 

To solve this problem, a recommendation system can be used. Based on the user profile, recent views and the content of the movie, we will be able to recommend movies that are more towards the interest of the user. The system will work based on a model trained using already existing data.

Goals

To build a model for a movie recommendation system that will learn from movie ratings, genres, recent views and user preferences and recommend movies that are more likely to be watched by the user.
To deploy the model in an application where it works with streaming data for more accurate recommendations.
Scale the application so it is able to work with large datasets( Big Data).
